# `LEFT JOIN` Studio

Welcome to LEFT JOIN Studio! We're your rapid-response task force, executing ideas with less hires or short timelines. With a focus on swift, autonomous execution and real-time user feedback, we bypass extensive upfront design to deliver solutions at lightning speed. By harnessing the latest AI tools, we automate mundane tasks, empowering your team to focus on strategic growth.

## Who We Are ...

> Like Lara Croft, Jason Bourne, and Rambo we are tech super heroes that get the job done at all cost.
> -- Founder

We reduce risk in your organizing due to our speed of execution and experimentation. **Version 0** of your idea can be experienced before traditional workflows are finished hiring, planning, or design.

## Who You Are ...

You are a founder, product manager, or team leader who needs to get things done. Your time is valuable and you need a team that can execute on your ideas quickly. You have a vision and need a team to help make it happen. You are looking for a partner that can help you build and validate your idea.

## What We Do ...

We create and validate ideas quickly. We build prototypes to help you learn faster. We help you find the right idea by building it fast with low risk.

## How We Do It ...

We work in one-week sprints focusing on building your idea. We demo our progress as it occurs and at the end of the week. We collaborate on what we learned and decide to a week at a time to continue or not. Additional weeks may be reserved in advance.

## Our Values ...

- **Speed** - We move quickly and execute on your idea.
- **Autonomy** - We work independently and don't need to be micromanaged.
- **Feedback** - We show you our work and learn from your feedback.
- **Experimentation** - We are always trying new things to learn and improve.

We are a `SAFE` way to pursue risky, high yield, innovation.
