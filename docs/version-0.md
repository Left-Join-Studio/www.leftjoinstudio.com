# Introducing **Version 0**: Rapid Prototyping for Innovation

In today's fast-paced world, innovation is key to staying ahead of the competition. However, bringing new ideas to life can be a daunting and expensive process. That's where "Version 0" comes in.

## What is Version 0?

"Version 0" is a concept that emphasizes the rapid prototyping of ideas to gather feedback and determine their viability. It is an approach where ideas are implemented as quickly as possible, with minimal documentation, to test their potential and gather valuable insights.

## The Power of Version 0

By embracing Version 0, companies can minimize the risks associated with pursuing costly and disruptive ideas. It allows them to validate concepts early on, saving time and resources that would otherwise be invested in fully-fledged projects that may not be feasible.

## How Version 0 Works

The core principle of Version 0 is to create a minimal viable **prototype** that captures the essence of the idea. This serves as an elevator pitch, providing a tangible representation of the concept that can be shared with stakeholders and potential users. This is **not** a product, we have dodged the product process and lag by calling out the prototype nature of the elevator pitch.
