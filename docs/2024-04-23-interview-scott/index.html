<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
Hey Jay, I‚Äôm Scott. I just started a new type of consulting company named Left Join Studio. We specialize in prototypes to validate ideas related to data driven products.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
Hey Scott! Welcome to the show. Left Join Studio sounds fascinating. Let‚Äôs dive right in‚Äîwhat inspired you to start a consulting company focused on data-driven product prototypes?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I‚Äôve always created products starting with prototypes to validate ideas. I‚Äôve always disliked getting too far into a product just to realize it was never going to work or spending time on user interfaces that users didn‚Äôt need. When I was working for other companies, product owners would often create long road maps to a destination I couldn‚Äôt believe in, and we‚Äôd get so far along that throwing it out would be considered ‚Äútoo wasteful.‚Äù So, we‚Äôd dig ourselves deeper into the hole, only to waste more resources. I created LJS to specialize in idea validation to avoid all this waste and get to the heart of the matter as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
Wow, Scott, that‚Äôs a really insightful approach. It sounds like you‚Äôre saving a lot of companies from falling into the classic trap of sunk cost fallacy. Can you share a specific example where a prototype from Left Join Studio helped a client pivot or refine their idea in a significant way?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
Yes, I‚Äôm an avid CLI (command-line interface) user, and I build most of my prototypes using it. When I worked with a consumer products goods company, they specified an entire business insights platform with many moving parts and a custom UI for it, and they were two years into the third rebuild of it. Naively, I wanted to verify how things were working by writing a few scripts to process the same data and generate the same insights, and I was finished after the first month on the job. The company ultimately rejected my solution and was offended that I even built it. Ever since then, I‚Äôve decided that I needed to start a company like LJS to focus on starting strong.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That‚Äôs a compelling story, Scott. It must have been frustrating to see your efficient solution go unappreciated, but it sounds like it fueled your mission with Left Join Studio. Given your focus on command line interfaces, do you find that clients are initially hesitant about not having a flashy UI, or are they usually on board once they see the speed and effectiveness of your prototypes?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I often work with developers and engineers who also understand CLI, so they love it. What goes wrong is that Product Owners (POs) and Managers don‚Äôt know CLI, so they need something else and never start there. POs often start with a UI and when they push their UI agenda, engineers forget to build APIs, CLIs, and data models in between. When we start with CLIs and data models, the UI often writes itself.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That‚Äôs a really interesting perspective, Scott. It makes a lot of sense to build a strong foundation first. So, when you‚Äôre working with a new client, how do you bridge that gap between the technical team who loves the CLI and the product owners who might be more visually oriented?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I like to make a board game out of the business process. Create game pieces for all the important roles. Create game cards to track stats and bonus. Use dice to accumulate assets, etc. If we can play the game in front of us, we can automate it. The board game is the first prototype and all parties can relate to it.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That‚Äôs a brilliant and creative approach, Scott! Turning a complex business process into a board game must make it a lot more tangible and engaging for everyone involved. Can you share a memorable moment or reaction from a client when they first experienced this board game method?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
Not any specific moment, but I do remember the relief and tension released. It‚Äôs how I know I‚Äôm on the right path. Jobs become simpler when we can do things in a simple way.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
I can imagine that sense of relief must be incredibly rewarding to witness. Simplifying complex processes is no small feat. What‚Äôs one piece of advice you would give to someone looking to adopt a more prototype-focused approach in their own projects?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
Don‚Äôt let your current progress and mindset hold you back from starting from scratch. I‚Äôve thrown away more projects than I‚Äôve completed, and that‚Äôs how it should be. Identifying failure and trying again is the heart of learning and innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That‚Äôs powerful advice, Scott. Embracing the idea of starting from scratch can be daunting, but it‚Äôs clearly a key to true innovation. Before we wrap up, what‚Äôs next for Left Join Studio? Any exciting projects or developments on the horizon?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I‚Äôm always on the lookout for the next ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù prototype challenge. Please contact us with it, I bet we can surprise even the hardest of skeptics. Thanks for having me!</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That sounds like a thrilling journey ahead, Scott! I‚Äôm sure our listeners will be intrigued by the challenges you take on. Thanks for sharing your insights and stories with us today. Best of luck with Left Join Studio, and keep pushing those boundaries!</p>
