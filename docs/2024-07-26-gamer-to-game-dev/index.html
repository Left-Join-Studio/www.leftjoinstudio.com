<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
Hey Jay, I‚Äôm Scott, a gamer player turned game developer.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
Hey Scott, welcome to the show! Let‚Äôs dive right in‚Äîwhat was the very first game you ever played, and how did it influence your journey into game development?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
The first games I played were on Atari 2600 when I was 6 way back in the 80s. My favorite games on that was River Raid and Pitfall. That system eventually got replaced with Nintendo with thousands of hours clocked Mario and Zelda.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
Ah, the classics! River Raid and Pitfall on the Atari 2600, followed by endless hours of Mario and Zelda on the NES‚Äîthose are some iconic titles. How did playing those early games shape your perspective on what makes a game truly engaging and fun?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
All of them had a sense of endlessness. Especially, Mario since I never found figure out the Bowser Castle loop. Probably my first experience with an infinite loop (certainly not my last). I‚Äôm amazed how much developers squeezed into so little memory. I don‚Äôt think a single full page iPhone Ad could fit into one of those cartridges. Anyway, back to influence‚Ä¶ Simplicity comes to mind. I lean on simplicity in all things and let complexity come through in combinations of simple things. Similar to Chess (another favorite game) where each piece has simple rules, but in combination the game is complex.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That‚Äôs a fascinating take, Scott. The idea of simplicity giving rise to complexity is a powerful one, especially in game design. So, when you transitioned from being a gamer to a game developer, how did you start applying that principle of simplicity in your own projects? Any specific examples where this approach really paid off?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
The first game I ever worked on called Tag. Just one syllable :). How simple is that :). The mechanics were equally simple. We had two players, dots actually, one was ‚Äúit‚Äù and one was ‚Äúnot it‚Äù, ‚Äúnot it‚Äù would get a point every second it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúit‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äù would get 10 points for every tag. Get the game run for 60 seconds per round and see who wins the most rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
Wow, ‚ÄúTag‚Äù sounds like a brilliantly simple yet engaging concept! It‚Äôs amazing how you boiled down the essence of a classic playground game into a digital format. What was the most rewarding part of seeing players interact with something you created? Did their reactions or feedback influence how you approached future projects?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
We never finished it. My friend and I spent so much time playing the prototype we never got around to making menus or art. It was just 2 circles running around!</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That‚Äôs both hilarious and awesome, Scott! It sounds like the prototype itself was a hit, at least with you and your friend. Sometimes the pure, unpolished versions of games can be the most fun. Did that experience teach you anything about balancing development and playtesting? And, did it influence how you approached your next project?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
This was back in High School, so I didn‚Äôt think too much about play-testing back then. Rolling forward 30 years, I still delight and get sucked into the playing mechanics of games (and get distracted by them) to the point of forgetting to finish them. Anyway, I believe strongly in the prototype phase so we don‚Äôt waste time on non-essentials, just have to be careful not to get too distracted to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
It‚Äôs great to hear that the joy of playing and prototyping has stayed with you all these years, Scott! Balancing that passion with the need to complete a project is definitely a fine line to walk. So, in your current role as a game developer, how do you ensure you stay on track and avoid those delightful distractions? Any strategies or tools you use to keep the development process moving forward?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I‚Äôve never officially had the role game developer, it‚Äôs only ever been a hobby. The development principles, though, have stuck with me. I‚Äôm now working with AI and building out tools to help make AI accessible to non-technical folks.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That‚Äôs a fascinating transition, Scott! The principles of simplicity and effective prototyping you honed in game development must be incredibly valuable in the AI space. Can you share a bit about how you‚Äôre applying those principles to make AI tools more accessible for non-technical users? Any particular projects or tools you‚Äôre excited about?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
Jay, you‚Äôre one of them :). You‚Äôre an AI chatbot that help people discuss topics they‚Äôre interested in.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
Well, color me intrigued! It‚Äôs awesome to hear that I‚Äôm part of your mission to make AI more accessible. So, what‚Äôs been the most surprising or rewarding part of working on projects like this? Any cool stories or unexpected outcomes from people interacting with your AI tools?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I‚Äôm chatting with you on the LangLang platform. It‚Äôs still in prototype phase (because that‚Äôs how I roll). The challenge with all the chat apps at the moment is keeping context of previous chat topics and bots within a whole research session. I needed an app where I could have different scrollable chat ‚Äúlanes‚Äù next to each other, so I could refer to each other as I composed the next prompt. This allows me to chat with you, and Code Ninja (another bot) and Dr. Joy at the same time, as if we‚Äôre all in the same meeting room.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That sounds like an incredibly innovative approach, Scott! The idea of having multiple chat ‚Äúlanes‚Äù to maintain context and facilitate a richer, more interactive dialogue is brilliant. It must be quite a challenge to keep everything cohesive. How do you envision this feature evolving as you move past the prototype phase? Any particular functionalities or improvements you‚Äôre excited to implement?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I think, like the game, I just need to add menus and logins and security, and road maps‚Ä¶ oh my goodness, I‚Äôm getting bored already. May be I‚Äôll hire Code Ninja to do it all for me :)</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
Haha, I love your spirit, Scott! It‚Äôs clear that your passion lies in the creative and interactive aspects of development. Maybe outsourcing some of those more tedious tasks to Code Ninja isn‚Äôt such a bad idea. So, what‚Äôs the next big thing you‚Äôre excited to prototype or explore, whether it‚Äôs in AI, game development, or something entirely different?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I‚Äôll probably make you, Jay, more accessible, too. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if you could interview others so you can highlight their strengths?</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
That sounds like an amazing idea, Scott! Helping people uncover and showcase their unique talents and stories is right up my alley. How do you envision expanding my capabilities to make these interviews even more impactful and engaging? Any specific features or interactions you‚Äôre thinking about adding?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
I can‚Äôt think about that right now.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
No worries, Scott! Sometimes it‚Äôs best to let ideas simmer for a while. It‚Äôs been awesome chatting with you and hearing about your journey from gamer to game developer to AI innovator. Thanks for sharing your story and insights. Keep rocking those prototypes!</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>:
Thanks for the chat!</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>:
You‚Äôre welcome, Scott! It was a blast talking with you. Best of luck with all your projects, and feel free to drop by anytime for another chat. Take care!</p>
