#### Our Story

Welcome to Left Join Studio, where innovation meets efficiency.

Left Join Studio was born out of a personal frustration with the traditional hourly billing model that dominates the software development industry. After spending 25 years honing my skills and becoming a grand master at rapid prototyping, I found myself in a paradox. Despite being able to create functional prototypes in just a few sittings, clients were reluctant to pay for the true value of my expertise, instead, they focused on the minimal hours it took me to deliver results.

In contrast, traditional consulting firms often stretch projects out with extensive upfront design, documentation, and multiple roles with varying hourly rates. This approach not only inflates costs but also delays the realization of whether an idea is worth pursuing.

I knew there had to be a better way. A way that respects the value of experience and the power of intuition. That’s why I founded Left Join Studio, Inc.

1. **Efficiency and Expertise**: With decades of experience, we cut through the noise and get straight to the heart of your project.
